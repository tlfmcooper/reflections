Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually rather than Git doing it automatically because some changes may not be enough to require a pull request

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks means you are cloning a third party repository on your GitHub 

Clones means you are downloading/copying a repository from GitHub/local folder to another local folder on your laptop

Branches is a label given to any of your commit uniquely identified with its SHA. New branches are created to try experimental features or another version of your master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that it allows you to have the latest updates to the remote if you are going to be offline.
You can then work on your master and merge both branches at a later time before pushing the updates to remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? Would it be easier or harder?

It would ve very inefficient to collaborate without Git/GitHub. The only solution would be either work on the same file together physically or using tools such as OneDrive/Google Drive/etc. But it would definitely be harder.

When woud you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefit does each approach have?

It is helpful to make changes in a separate branch rather than master when you want to try experimental features and
you would like to have other people feedback on it before adding it to your master. This allows for more creativity
and give you the liberty to try out new features without the fear to break anything.
