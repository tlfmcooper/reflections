Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually rather than Git doing it automatically because some changes may not be enough to require a pull request

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks means you are cloning a third party repository on your GitHub 

Clones means you are downloading/copying a repository from GitHub/local folder to another local folder on your laptop

Branches is a label given to any of your commit uniquely identified with its SHA. New branches are created to try experimental features or another version of your master branch.
