Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually rather than Git doing it automatically because some changes may not be enough to require a pull request

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks means you are cloning a third party repository on your GitHub 

Clones means you are downloading/copying a repository from GitHub/local folder to another local folder on your laptop

Branches is a label given to any of your commit uniquely identified with its SHA. New branches are created to try experimental features or another version of your master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that it allows you to have the latest updates to the remote if you are going to be offline.
You can then work on your master and merge both branches at a later time before pushing the updates to remote.
