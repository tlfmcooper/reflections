What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A branch would be useful when you want to test an experimental feature,
create another version of the code( for example a version in anothe language),
and you don't to want to mess up with your main code. Branches allow you the
liberty to do that without fearing breaking your code.
